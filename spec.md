# Company website Plan

## The Problem

We are a startup creating productivity apps, and we're in the stage of development where we build several apps and see what works. We need an apple developer account to be able to effectively work as a team, but a website is a requirement to have an organization developer account. We are not prepared to spend the time, money, and resources to create a fully featured site for solutions we don't even have yet, nor are we willing to deal with the headaches that come with sharing individual developer accounts.

## The Solution

We need a minimalistic landing page with the bare minimum that apple requires to validate our organization developer account. This includes the following key details:
- Mission: To make digital productivity effective, engaging, and accessible to everyone.
- Vision: We aim to lead the way in an erra of digital productivity solutions that are not only engaging, but also increase the productivity of the modern user and are accessible to users of all abilities.

## The Plan

1. Research apple's specific requirements for a landing page that is sufficient to get an organization developer account, including examples of what other companies in similar situations have done.
2. Plan a webpage that includes the above elements and any other necessary information derived from your research. When creating a privacy policy, do not generate your own. Use a well-known generator. The policy should reflect our situation as a startup with no products, user accounts, or any other data collection beyond that which is necessary to access the webpages we're hosting.
3. Create the webpage and privacy policy using a free static site generator that does not require signup and allows you to download the files and host them yourself.
4. Ensure we're fully committed and pushed, then use gh and the browser agent to go to the repo on github and get it hosted on github pages with the domain cartec-innovations.com.
5. Again using the browser agent, go to ccartec-innovations.com and verify that we do indeed have a landing page that meets apple's requirements, includes all company information exactly as written, and meets a minimum standard of quality and professionalism.
